# StackRadar

**StackRadar** is a project created by a programming student at **Lincoln University**, who previously worked as a **senior product manager** at a tech giant in China. StackRadar aims to help junior developers understand what tech skills are most in demand in **New Zealand**, so they can better prepare before entering the job market. It also allows users to **filter jobs based on their own tech stacks**, making the job search more efficient and accurate.

### 🔍 Problem Observation

The idea behind this platform comes from two personal observations I made during my time as a student and job seeker in New Zealand.

1️⃣ First, it seems that all of my classmates understand we can’t rely solely on what the university teaches us to find a job in New Zealand. The typical tech stack we use in school — `Python`, `Flask`, `Bootstrap`, `MySQL`, and `PythonAnywhere` — isn’t widely used in the local industry. Everyone is aware of this, but no one seems to take the next step and ask:  
> “If not this, then what?”

I did some research on the most popular tech stacks in New Zealand, but the results I found weren’t very convincing. Most of them were just like someone sharing their personal opinions — ranking so-called “in-demand” skills and saying things like “If you don’t have this skill, you’re in trouble” — without providing any solid data or evidence to back it up.

2️⃣ Second, when I was searching for jobs, I realized that the way developers look for jobs today could be much easier. Unlike many other industries, in the developer job market, tech stack fit is often a deciding factor. Nowadays, employers always include their tech stack requirements in ridiculously long job descriptions — sometimes it feels like it takes forever just to read through everything. That’s when I started thinking:  
> “If I could filter jobs based on the tech stacks I know, wouldn’t that make the whole process much easier?”

However, platforms like Seek cover everything, but that also means they won't go deep or address the specific hiring needs of niche industries.

### 💡 Product Logic

This is exactly an area where I knew I could make a difference.

After spending an afternoon in the Lincoln University library, I scraped my first batch of public developer job data. From that moment on, the picture in my mind became much clearer: 

> I could maintain a tech stack keyword list and calculate how frequently each keyword appeared in real job postings. That frequency basically reflects the demand for each tech stack in the actual job market. By labeling each job with the tech stacks it requires, we can then filter jobs based on our own tech stack. That’s the core product logic behind StackRadar.

### 🎯 Final Message

For students like me or other junior developers, there’s one thing I really hope you take away from StackRadar: That you gain a clear understanding of what tech skills are actually in demand in New Zealand — and what skills you already have. Keep that in mind — and make sure you're well prepared before entering the job market.

Good luck to everyone on your job search journey.  🚀
